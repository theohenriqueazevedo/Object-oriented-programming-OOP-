# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects—instances of classes. This approach facilitates code reusability, maintenance, and scalability.

## Key Concepts
### 1. Classes and Objects
- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object:** An instance of a class.

### 2. Encapsulation
- Hides internal details of an object and exposes only what is necessary.
- Utilizes access modifiers (in Python, by convention, prefixing an attribute with an underscore to indicate it should be treated as private).

### 3. Inheritance
- Allows a child class to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class.

### 4. Polymorphism
- Enables a method to have different behaviors based on the object that invokes it.

### 5. Abstraction
- Hides complex details and exposes only essential features of an object.

## Benefits of OOP
- Improves code organization.
- Enhances reusability.
- Reduces complexity.
- Simplifies maintenance.
